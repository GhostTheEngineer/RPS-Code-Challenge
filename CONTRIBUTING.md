# Contributing to the Rock Paper Scissors Code Challenge

Thank you for your interest in improving the Rock Paper Scissors game! Follow these steps to participate in the challenge.

## üöÄ How to Submit Your Code

### **Step 1: Fork This Repository**
1. Go to the **main repository** on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner of the page). This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### **Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt (in a directory of your choosing on your machine).
2. Run the following command (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RPS-Code-Challenge.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```sh
   cd RPS-Code-Challenge
   ```

### **Step 3: Create a New Branch**
- Before making any changes, create a new branch to keep your modifications organized:
  ```sh
  git checkout -b code-yourname
  ```
  Replace `yourname` with your GitHub username or a short description of your changes.

### **Step 4: Make Your Changes**
- Improve the code by **fixing bugs, optimizing performance, or adding features**.
- **Avoid unnecessary complexity** and ensure your changes enhance the game.
- **No third-party libs**, lets keep things simple and remain console app.
- **Document Your Changes**: use the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) to document neatly.

### **Step 5: Commit Your Changes**
1. Stage your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit with a meaningful message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Optimized random number generation for better performance"
   ```

### **Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub**
- Send your changes to your forked repository(your account):
  ```sh
  git push origin code-yourname
  ```

### **Step 7: Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
1. Go to **main repository** on GitHub [click here](https://github.com/GhostTheEngineer/RPS-Code-Challenge).
2. Click on **"Pull Request"** then **"New Pull Request"**.
3. Select your fork and the branch containing your changes **code-yourname**.
4. Click **"Compare & pull request"**.
5. Choose the **base repository** (the main repo) and the **correct branch** (`main`).
6. Add a clear **title and description** of your optimizations.
7. Click **"Create pull request"**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- PRs **will NOT be merged**; they are for reviewing and discussing optimizations.
- If your code stands out, it may be featured in the **Hall of Fame**.
- Keep your code **clean, efficient, and well-documented**.

Happy coding! üöÄüî•
